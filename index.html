            <h1>Mushroom Lamp &#128512;</h1>
             <p>My final project is a cute Enoki mushroom lamp. I got the idea from an ad so I built one by my self. </p>
              <p>This lamp is not only beautiful but also practical. You only need to press the button to select a variety
                 of functions. At the same time, it is also a sensor light. It will light up automatically when it senses someone approaching 
                within two meters. Perfectly solved the problem of not being able to find the button in the dark.
